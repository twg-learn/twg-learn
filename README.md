## Hi, I'm T-Dawg! ðŸ‘‹

### About me
I'm fairly new to software development. I began my tech-related educational journey back in 2020 when a prevailing public health crisis forced me to begin considering a different career choice, sometime in the near future. Without being in a degree program and being entirely self taught, it took me a while to accumlate enough knowledge to clearly see a path forward, but I am now confident enough to continue my learning in a more formal and social format.

### GitHub Account Primary Goal & Purpose
This account is specifically dedicated to hosting and documenting my projects and progress as a **student** in software development. The ultimate goal of this journaling is to eventually use it as credentials for entry into a higher education program, an internship, or an entry level job.
